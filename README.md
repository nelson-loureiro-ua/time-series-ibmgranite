# Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) Prediction
## Introduction
India, home to over 1.4 billion people, faces a severe air pollution crisis, with many cities ranking among the most polluted in the world. Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and increasing vehicular emissions have led to dangerously high levels of pollutants, particularly PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, and CO. Poor air quality has significant health, environmental, and economic impacts, making it one of India's most pressing challenges.

## Problem Statement
Air pollution is a critical environmental issue in India, with cities like Ghaziabad experiencing high levels of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants. PM2.5, which consists of fine airborne particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers, poses serious health risks, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and reduced life expectancy.

This project aims to develop a forecasting model to predict future PM2.5 levels in Hyderabad based on other air quality parameters such as PM10, NO₂, CO, O₃, temperature, and humidity. The final goal is to provide a reliable prediction system that can forecast air pollution levels and aid in urban planning, health advisories, and environmental regulations.

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhisheksjha/time-series-air-quality-data-of-india-2010-2023/data) contains data about the air quality conditions for 453 Indian cities from the year 2010 to 2023. The data has been collected from the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management, which indicates that it is a reliable and authoritative source. Amongst other air quality parameters, this dataset includes the following variables:
1. From Date: Starting date of data collection
2. To Date: Ending date of data collection
3. PM10: Particulate Matter 10
4. PM2.5: Particulate Matter 2.5
5. CO: Carbon Monoxide
6. CO2: Carbon Dioxide
7. NO: Nitric Oxide
8. NO2: Nitrogen Dioxide
9. NH3: Ammonia
10. SO2: Sulfur Dioxide
11. Temp: Temperature
12. AT: Air Temperature
13. BP: Barometric Pressure
14. RH: Relative Humidity
